                Professional Summary
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
  I am a dedicated full-stack developer with a proven track record of creating robust, scalable, and efficient software solutions. My professional journey has been shaped by hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies, deep problem-solving capabilities, and a passion for driving innovation in the fields of software development, machine learning, and cloud computing. 
</p>
<p className="text-gray-300 mt-4">
  My expertise lies in developing end-to-end web applications using modern frameworks and tools like React, Node.js, Python, and Flask. Iâ€™ve architected and implemented projects such as a <strong>Search Rule Engine using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)</strong>, where I designed a scalable backend using Flask, integrated MongoDB for efficient data storage, and developed a user-friendly Streamlit interface. This project exemplifies my ability to combine performance optimization with user-centric design, achieving over 95% accuracy in rule execution and earning positive feedback from beta users.
</p>
<p className="text-gray-300 mt-4">
  I have also developed a <strong>Full-Stack Online Coding Platform</strong>, enabling users to practice coding in Python, C++, Java, and C. This platform supports over 1,000 API requests per second and features robust error handling and monitoring. I designed a responsive front-end interface with a built-in code editor, problem-solving playground, and leaderboard, which achieved a 95% user satisfaction rate. My work on this project reflects my commitment to creating seamless, user-focused applications with high scalability and reliability.
</p>
<p className="text-gray-300 mt-4">
  In addition to my technical expertise, I am well-versed in deploying and managing cloud infrastructures. I have worked extensively with platforms like AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Azure, enabling me to build and maintain secure, cost-efficient, and high-performing systems. My certifications, including AWS Certified Solutions Architect and Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer, demonstrate my deep understanding of cloud technologies and best practices.
</p>
<p className="text-gray-300 mt-4">
  My experience also includes leveraging advanced machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn to deliver intelligent solutions. I have implemented natural language processing (NLP) systems for projects like a meeting summarizer, using tools like FFmpeg and OpenAI Whisper to achieve high data accuracy and performance optimization. I take pride in creating solutions that are not only technically robust but also practical and scalable.
</p>
<p className="text-gray-300 mt-4">
  Beyond technical work, I am passionate about contributing to the tech community and fostering growth among peers. As a mentor in the WeCode Club, I have guided over 300 students, improved project completion rates by 30%, and coordinated workshops and hackathons that drove a 40% increase in participation. I actively participate in open-source programs such as GSSOC and Hacktoberfest, contributing to community-driven projects and enhancing collaborative development.
</p>
<p className="text-gray-300 mt-4">
  My professional toolkit includes a diverse range of skills and technologies, such as Python, JavaScript, Flask, MongoDB, TensorFlow, and RESTful APIs. I have a strong foundation in domains like AI, ML, NLP, backend development, and cloud architecture, coupled with a commitment to agile methodologies and best practices. These skills, combined with my problem-solving mindset and passion for innovation, drive my ability to create impactful solutions that align with modern technological demands.
</p>
<p className="text-gray-300 mt-4">
  As I continue to grow as a developer, my vision is to leverage technology to solve real-world challenges, contribute to open-source innovation, and mentor the next generation of developers. I aim to push the boundaries of what is possible in software development, creating solutions that leave a lasting impact.
